##This is my Sublime Text environment for ColdFusion development
===============================================

To setup a new environment with all the plugins/settings that I have, simply clone this repo into your Packages/User/ folder, then launch Sublime Text3.  

You can get to that folder from within SublimeText by clicking the `Preferences` menu and selecting `Browse Packages`
